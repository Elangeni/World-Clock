# World-Clock

Recently, I learned about objects, arrays, and nodes in Javascript. I was inspired to use what I learned to create a world clock.

On the opening page, the user is granted with a large clock that displays the time where they are, and 4 large clocks that display theime in four major cities(New York, Tokyo, Moscow, and London).
